# Updates

## DeepDiff 7.0.0 - Apr 8 2024

- DeepDiff 7 comes with an improved delta object. [Delta to flat dictionaries](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/serialization.html#delta-serialize-to-flat-dictionaries) have undergone a major change. We have also introduced [Delta serialize to flat rows](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/serialization.html#delta-serialize-to-flat-rows).
- Subtracting delta objects have dramatically improved at the cost of holding more metadata about the original objects.
- When `verbose=2`, and the "path" of an item has changed in a report between t1 and t2, we include it as `new_path`.
- `path(use_t2=True)` returns the correct path to t2 in any reported change in the [`tree view`](https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/view.html#tree-view)
- Python 3.7 support is dropped and Python 3.12 is officially supported.
